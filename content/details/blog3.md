## HIST 4805A: Bad Archaeology: The Trade in Human Remains & Other Antiquities

By some reckonings, the economic value of the illegal trade in antiquities is on the same order of magnitude as that for drugs and weapons. This seminar will explore the 20th century history of looting, heritage crime, and the damage done by the wanton destruction of cultural heritage to feed this trade. It is offered in conjunction with the 2018 Shannon Lecture Series, ‘Bad Archaeology’ which explores the broader theme of the use and abuse of archaeological knowledge. Student projects will intersect with Graham and Huffer’s SSHRC-funded research project on the trade in human remains facilitated by social media. Students will develop and test digital humanities’ tools and approaches from this project in the broader antiquities trade.

Students in this seminar will thus make a real contribution to the study of heritage crime, and will be acknowledged on any resulting publications, and shed light on a trade conducted in the shadows.

### Meeting Time

Wednesdays, 11:35 am - 2:25 pm, Loeb Building A204

If you have a laptop, bring it. Even a tablet can be helpful.

**I also require attendance at the 'Bad Archaeology' Shannon Lecture Series:**

+ Donna Yates - Oct 12  - on the Persepolis fragment theft from the Montreal museum of fine arts, the broader trade in antiquities & Canada’s place in it
+ Steph Halmhofer - Oct 19 – on pseudoarchaeology and social media,
+ Kisha Suprenant - Nov 9  - on the abuse of archaeology against Metis peoples in Western Canada
+ Katherine Cook - Nov 23 – on digital public archaeology in Canada and digital colonialism
+ Morag Kersel – Nov 30  - on looting in the Near East

More details, including abstracts and the start time, will be provided. All Shannon Lectures will take place in DT2017.

Because I am expecting you to attend the Shannons, there will be five fewer sessions in the winter session.

## Structure

The course is divided into two broad halves: the first half of the course sets the stage for your own research project you will undertake in the second. Each meeting will be a combination of discussion of readings, podcasts, or videos, and exercises designed to promote facility with digital research methods and sources. Each week, students will begin the class with a free-writing session. These are not formal essays, but rather more like research notes that summarize the elements that strike the student as most important, most puzzling, most surprising, most troubling... from these we will build a collaborative research discussion each week. These will be collated to our course website in the [student posts section](/articles/). Why? Because what we are doing _is interesting_; other people find value in it. Research is a conversation, and this is one of the ways we will give back.

See the [schedule](/details/schedule/) for the readings for each week; in the second term take note of the precise meeting dates.

## Grading

+ Classroom Presence 20%
+ Community of Practice 30%
+ Research Project 50%

Classroom Presence will be graded by your peers on a three point scale: excellent peer; supportive peer; could improve meaningfully. I will take the average of how your peers grade you.

Community of Practice will be graded by you. Details on how this plays out are on the [schedule page](/details/schedule/), but in essence, you are making the argument for how you have made a meaningful contribution to our classroom learning.

Part of your [Research Project](/details/research/) grade will be determined by your presence and collaborative engagement in the second term 'workshopping' sessions.

## Plagiarism

The University Senate defines plagiarism as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.” This can include:

- reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation or reference to the original source;
- submitting a take home examination, essay, laboratory report or other assignment written, in whole orin part, by someone else;
- using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, or paraphrased material, concepts, or ideas without appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment;
- using another’s data or research findings;
- failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another’s works and/or failing to use quotation marks;
- handing in "substantially the same piece of work for academic credit more than once without prior written permission of the course instructor in which the submission occurs."

Plagiarism is a serious offense which cannot be resolved directly with the course’s instructor. The Associate Dean of the Faculty conducts a rigorous investigation, including an interview with the student, when an instructor suspects a piece of work has been plagiarized. Penalties are not trivial. They can include a final grade of "F" for the course.

## Statement on Class Conduct

The Carleton University Human Rights Policies and Procedures affirm that all members of the University community share a responsibility to:

- promote equity and fairness,
- respect and value diversity,
- prevent discrimination and harassment, and
- preserve the freedom of its members to carry out responsibly their scholarly work without threat of interference.

Carleton University Equity Services states that "every member of the University community has a right to study, work and live in a safe environment free of discrimination or harassment".

Standing in a course is determined by the course instructor subject to the approval of the Faculty Dean. This means that grades submitted by the instructor may be subject to revision. No grades are final until they have been approved by the Dean.

## Withdrawal without financial/academic penalty

The last date to withdraw without financial penalty is September 30, 2018. The last date for academic withdrawal is December 7, 2018.

## Requests for academic accommodation

You may need special arrangements to meet your academic obligations during the term because of disability, pregnancy or religious obligations. Please review the course outline promptly and write to the instructor with any requests for academic accommodation during the first two weeks of class, or as soon as possible after the need for accommodation is known to exist. The Paul Menton Centre for Students with Disabilities (PMC) provides services to students with Learning Disabilities (LD), psychiatric/mental health disabilities, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), chronic medical conditions, and impairments in mobility, hearing, and vision. If you have a disability requiring academic accommodations in this course, please contact PMC at 613-520-6608 or pmc [at] carleton [dot] ca for a formal evaluation.

If you are already registered with the PMC, contact your PMC coordinator to send the instructor your Letter of Accommodation at the beginning of the term, and no later than two weeks before the first in-class scheduled test or exam requiring accommodation (if applicable). After requesting accommodation from PMC, meet with the instructor to ensure accommodation arrangements are made.Please consult the PMC website for the deadline to request accommodations for the formally-scheduled exam(if applicable)
