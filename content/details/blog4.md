We meet on Wednesdays, 11.35 - 2.25 in LA A204.

In general, our meetings will look like this:

### Before class
- read and [annotate](http://hypothes.is) the introductory reading(s) for the week's theme
- use the weekly theme to search JSTOR, our shared library, etc to find, read, and annotate _two_ additional pieces
- add _just one_ of those additional pieces to our [shared Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2213209/hist4805a-bad-archaeology)

nb: you can [follow our hypothes.is group feed](https://hypothes.is/groups/zLnyJnw2/hist4805a) to find a reading; that is to say, it's ok if multiple people read the same additional pieces

### During class

**Part One:**

- The **first twenty minutes** will be for free writing about what you've read (and observed in the annotations, if appropriate). This writing doesn't have to be overly formal, but it should engage with what you've read: what puzzles you? what intrigues you? what has been left out, elided, or otherwise glossed over? Are there any [logical fallacies](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/fallacies/) and if so, are they consciously or unconsciously deployed? Who is hurt by the argument? Who profits from it? What are the key issues? How do these connect to things you read or listened to the previous week? And so on.
- Weeks in which there is a Shannon Lecture: your free writing should also include reflection on what you heard, and what you discussed, with the visiting lecturer.

**Part Two:**

- You will then make suggestions, given what you wrote, to the class as a whole about what things you'd like to discuss as a group. These will be written on the board; the class will then get to make *two* votes, as represented by tally marks, under the topics that strike each person as most interesting.
- We will then break into two groups to discuss the highest-voted issues. Each group **must** elect a recorder. Ideally these groups will be evenly split (we are following the 'unconference' model here). The person who proposed the idea will kick off the discussion.
  - the **recorder** will compile a written record of the discussion, which will be sent to Dr. Graham by the next day, for posting on the course website.
  - every student will have to be recorder at least once
  - the point of these records is to provide public-facing engagement with an interested public who might be following along
  - these records, as well as your own free writing, will be central to the development of your own research project in term 2. They will help you create the literature review, the grounding, for your project work.
  - We will then 'shuffle the deck' to bring the discussions to the entire group (a person from group 1 pairs off with a person from group 2).

**Part Three:**

- Digital Methods Practice - the next element of the class will be to learn and practice various digital methods that will equip you to participate in the Bone Trade project, and indeed in your own research.
- We'll conclude with Graham setting up the next week's topic with background.

### Assessment of the in-class work
You will make the case to me what grade your engagement and participation ought to receive in the first term. You will do this by reference to your free-writing and the records published on our course website. Frame this as a discussion of how you have grown as a scholar; tie it into the particular issues raised, and especially, in contrast to what you thought about the issues when you first signed up for the course. Two pages should be sufficient. Cite any relevant literature or posts as appropriate.

If I agree with you (if you've made your case), you will receive that grade. If not, you will have a chance to respond to my concerns.

## Texts

There is no one set textbook for this course. I find the following books to be quite intriguing and even entertaining, and we will be using many of the papers contained therein. You may find all of these in the [library reserves](https://library.carleton.ca/find/reserves) for our course.

**You are not required to buy any of these volumes** Again, I have put these and a variety of other resources from our library [on reserve](https://library.carleton.ca/find/reserves). Some of these volumes are my own personal copies and I ask you to treat them with respect _and don't break the spine_.

## Schedule and Themes, Fall Term

Readings are denoted with bullet points; just because I've put something down as a reading doesn't necessarily mean that I am endorsing it... always ask yourself: why is this here? Search our [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2213209/hist4805a-bad-archaeology/items/collectionKey/B7HUG4AJ) and ask, whose voices are missing? Whose voice can _you_ bring to the table? [Citation is a gift...](https://footnotesblog.com/2018/07/07/guest-post-citation-is-a-gift-punking-accounting-in-hautalk/)

You might also want to [explore these topics as they span across 20000 articles from archaeological journals](http://graeworks.net/digitalarchae/20000/).
