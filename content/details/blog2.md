# Second Term Research Projects

The second term will be taken up largely with your own individual research projects. In exceptional circumstances, I'm willing to allow other configurations of work _provided_ that the individuals involved work out in writing who will do what and who is going to be responsible for the overall management of the work.

**In general**

The projects should:

- address the core themes of this course
- demonstrate mastery over a body of material, in terms of the issues raised and the relevant scholarly literature
- make a new contribution to a body of research addressed in this course

**The technical aspects**

The projects should:

- have a public facing project page hosted on [Github.com](http://github.com) using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- make all code available (consider also the use of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) + [Binder](http://mybinder.org) to make your code instantly replicable and actionable)
- have a data repository using [osf.io](https://osf.io/) where you give Dr. Graham access. We will consider together whether or not (or in what circumstances) your data can be made public.

- Digital work is a team sport. I expect you to be present and to have meaningful collaborative engagement in the second term 'workshopping' sessions.

### But I'm not techy!

You will be. If you can write an essay on your computer, you can collect, explore, evaluate, and analyze data. We will be using the [Open Digital Archaeology Text](http://o-date.github.io) and the [Workbook for Crafting Digital History](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca) to bring your digital literacy up to par.

### Possible topics

Off the top of my head, I can think of a wide variety of topics worth exploring:

- human remains in Canadian collections
- unprovenanced artefacts in Ottawa museums and collections
- abuses of archaeological knowledge in an age of resurgent neo-fascism
- archaeology in the service of Mussolini/nationalism/nation building/racism.... etc...
- genetic tests, personal identity, and archaeology
- digital colonialism and ethical digital archaeology
- popular archaeology and unpopular archaeology: academics and entertainers
- data mining / text analysis of newspaper articles pertaining to archaeology

**You should settle on a general idea for your project by early November; I want this pinned down by the end of November.**

**In the second term we will meet periodically to compare notes, troubleshoot, and workshop what we're working on.**
